I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect
But you're not coming home with me tonight

    You just want attention
    You don't want my heart
    Maybe you just hate the thought
    of me with someone new
    Yeah, you just want attention
    I knew from the start
    You're just making sure
    I'm never gettin' over you
